    <p>
        Welcome to the Fulvo Database Web UI. 
        This is a web application that allows users to interact with an Oracle database with populated (fake) data.
        The database consists of seven different tables: Users, Players, Referees, Teams, House_League, Match_Stats, and Match_Referee.
        Each table has its own unique attributes and relationships with other tables.
    </p> 
    
    <h3> Application Details </h3>
    <p>
        The database was created using PL/SQL (Oracle SQL), with separate SQL scripts for creating, populating, and querying. 
        We executed these scripts with Oracle SQL*Plus and Oracle SQL Developer.
        As for the web interface, we decided to use Python and Flask as our backend framework, with SQLAlchemy as the ORM (Object Relational Mapper).
        We also used Jinja2 as our a templating engine (as it comes with Flask), 
        and jQuery is utilized in the frontend for interacting with the backend and adding functionality.
        As for our styling, we combined custom CSS and Bootstrap to create a clean and simple design.
    </p>
    
    <h3> User Requirements </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Perform certain SQL queries (for example, select all that are skill level advanced)</li>
        <li>Create, read, update, and delete records for each table</li>
        <li>Search for specific records for each table</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Click on each item on the navbar to be able to visualize these requirements.</p>
    
    <h3> Quick Database Overview </h3>
    <p>To look at each table in the Fulvo Database, select the corresponding button to see the corresponding table.</p>
